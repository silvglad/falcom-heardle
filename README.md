# Falcom Heardle

A Heardle application for Falcom's franchises' soundtrack, including Ys and Trails

- Based on the original [Heardle](https://www.heardle.app) website, where you guess a random song from its intro in as little tries as possible. Source code originally provided by [WJSN Heardle](https://github.com/jeroldcamacho/wjsn-heardle)
- Used to be hosted at [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) back in 2022, where it amassed a fair amount of popularity and attention from the community surrounding Falcom games
